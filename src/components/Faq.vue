      It&#39;s been a week since I requested an account, what happened!
    </h4>
    <p>
      Accounts are typically processed immediately. If your account requires
      additional approval by staff, it may take a few days (usually less) to be
      manually approved. If this was the case, you will have been informed
      during account creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases when people think their account has not been created, the
      email landed in their spam folder. Check that first, or try to [[reset
      your password|change_password]] to see if your account has been created.

    <h4 id="i-think-i-left-something-in-the-lab-can-you-tell-me-if-it-s-there-">
      I think I left something in the lab, can you tell me if it&#39;s there?
    </h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Please do not email us about items lost in the lab.</strong> The
      front desk is staffed by paid employees, not by OCF volunteers. If you
      email us, the front desk staff <em>will not see it</em>. If you&#39;ve
      lost something, you should instead stop by in-person to ask for it.
