title: "Account policies"

_As amended by the Board of Directors, November 13, 2017._

OCF users must respect the rights of other users, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.

Students and employees may have rights of access to information about themselves contained in computer files, as specified in federal and state laws. Files may be subject to search under court order. In addition, system administrators may access user files as required to protect the integrity or orderly functioning of computer systems. For example, system administrators may access or examine files or accounts that are suspected of unauthorized use or misuse, or that have been corrupted or damaged. System administrators may also access or modify files or accounts by request of the account holder.

All existing laws (federal and state) and University regulations and policies apply, including not only those laws and regulations that are specific to computers and networks, but also those that may apply generally to personal conduct.

Furthermore, the OCF provides its services on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, including, but not limited to, any warranties of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The OCF is also NOT LIABLE for any damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising out of or in connection with the OCF. While OCF staff try to make services useful for all members, they cannot guarantee that the services will always work for everyone.

**It is the responsibility of users to keep their accounts secure and in good working order, and to maintain timely communications with OCF staff**. OCF staff may disable the accounts of those who do not comply with these account requirements as evidenced by (but not limited to) any of the following:

1. Failing to respond to communications from OCF staff or to maintain a current email address on file

2. Failing to respond to an account compromise

3. Leaving the account vulnerable to security threats

4. Causing excessive disruption to OCF services, whether intentional or not

5. Neglecting to use the account for an extended period of time

Misuse of lab, computer, networking, or information resources may result in the loss of computing or lab privileges. Users may be held accountable for their conduct under any applicable University or campus policies, procedures, or collective bargaining agreements. Illegal reproduction of software protected by U.S. Copyright Law is subject to civil damages and criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment.

**Examples of misuse** include, but are not limited to:

1. Using or allowing someone else to use a computer account that you are not authorized to use, such as by obtaining a password for a computer account without the consent of the account owner, or by sharing your account password.
2. Using the campus network to gain unauthorized access to any computer systems.
3. Knowingly performing an act which will interfere with the normal operation of computers, terminals, peripherals, or networks.
4. Knowingly running or installing on any computer system or network, or giving to another user, a program intended to damage or to place excessive load on a computer system or network. This includes but is not limited to programs known as computer viruses, Trojan horses, and worms.
5. Attempting to circumvent data protection schemes or uncovering security loopholes.
6. Violating terms of applicable software licensing agreements or copyright laws.
7. Using electronic mail or communication to harass other users or send bulk unsolicited communications.
8. Posting materials on electronic bulletin boards that violate existing laws or the University's codes of conduct.
9. Attempting to monitor or tamper with another user's electronic communications, or reading, copying, changing, or deleting another user's files or software without the explicit agreement of the owner.
10. Using OCF or University equipment or resources for commercial purposes unless specifically authorized.
11. Failing to follow common rules of etiquette while in the lab or while using OCF services.

Violations of this policy or any other OCF policy may result in account suspension. Additionally, misuse may result in suspension or termination of computing privileges. Furthermore, OCF staff may disable an account and/or ban a person from the OCF if there exist exigent circumstances which require such actions.

The banning of any person from the OCF will be subject to the [User Banning Policy](/docs/internal/membership/banning/).
