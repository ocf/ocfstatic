### Need help from an OCF staffer?

OCF staff are student volunteers who are usually not present in the lab.

The front desk staff can help with basic troubleshooting, but for technical or organization-related questions, it would be better to either chat with an OCF volunteer staffer during [staff hours](/staff-hours) or contact us via [email](/docs/internal/contact).

### Location

The OCF computer lab is located in 171 MLK Student Union. It can be accessed through the main MLK building or via the tunnel by the stairs between Upper and Lower Sproul.

To enter the lab, **bring a valid student identification card; you will be asked to show it.**
