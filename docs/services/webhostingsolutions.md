## What type of web hosting do I need?

The OCF offers two main types of hosting, personal hosting and group hosting. If you have a personal account (which most people have unless you have requested a group account), then your main option is personal hosting. If you have a group account for a Registered Student Organization, then you have a couple options for your hosting solutions, which are listed in the group hosting section.

## Hosting your personal site

See [personal hosting documentation](/docs/services/web/) to get started!

## Hosting your group's site

You should start with our [virtual hosting documentation](/docs/services/vhost/) if you are just getting started with group hosting at the OCF. If you have applied and been approved for application hosting, head over to the [app hosting documentation](/docs/services/webapps/).
